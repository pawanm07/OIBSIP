# Car Price Prediction and Sales Prediction Project

This repository contains Two distinct data analysis and prediction projects using Python and various machine learning techniques. Each project focuses on different datasets and objectives:

## Car Price Prediction

### Overview

The Car Price Prediction project aims to predict the selling price of cars based on various features using machine learning algorithms.

### Dataset

Source : Car data.csv 

Description : The dataset contains information about car attributes such as year, present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission type, and owner details.

### Dependencies

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip install scikit-learn
```

### Libraries Used
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

### Key Steps

- Data preprocessing including handling missing values and categorical variables.
- Exploratory data analysis to understand relationships and distributions.
- Building and evaluating predictive models using Linear Regression and Lasso Regression.
- Visualizing model performance with scatter plots and evaluating accuracy with R-squared.
